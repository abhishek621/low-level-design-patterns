Memento : 
Also known as Snapshot, Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save 
and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its 
implementation The Memento pattern delegates creating the state snapshots to the 
actual owner of that state, the originator object. Hence, instead of other objects 
trying to copy the editor’s state from the “outside,” the editor class itself can 
make the snapshot since it has full access to its own state, The pattern suggests 
storing the copy of the object’s state in a special object called memento. The 
contents of the memento aren’t accessible to any other object except the one that 
produced it Other objects must communicate with mementos using a limited interface
which may allow fetching the snapshot’s metadata (creation time, the name of the 
performed operation, etc.), but not the original object’s state contained in the 
snapshot

The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows capturing and 
storing the current state of an object (the originator) without violating 
encapsulation. This stored state can later be restored to bring the object 
back to its previous state

Key Concepts of Memento Pattern :

Originator: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored

Memento: Represents the stored state of the Originator

CareTaker: Responsible for holding and managing Mementos

Client: Initiates requests to save and restore Originator's state

Use Cases : 
This example illustrates how the Memento pattern can be used in gaming scenarios

Save-Load Mechanism: Saving and restoring game states, such as player health, position, and progress

Undo Mechanism: Allowing players to undo actions or revert to previous game states

Checkpoint Systems: Implementing checkpoints where game states can be saved and restored

Conclusion : 
The Memento pattern is useful in scenarios where you need to save and restore the state 
of an object, providing mechanisms for undo operations, checkpoints, and game saves In 
this example, we applied the Memento pattern to manage the state of a game character's 
health points, demonstrating its practical use in game development and beyond
