Abstract Factory : 

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides 
an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without 
specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly useful when 
the system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, 
and represented, and when families of related products need to be used together

Key Concepts of Abstract Factory Pattern : 
Abstract Factory: Declares an interface for creating abstract product objects

Concrete Factory: Implements the operations to create concrete product objects

Abstract Product: Declares an interface for a type of product object

Concrete Product: Defines a product object to be created by the corresponding 
				  concrete factory, implementing the abstract product interface

Client: Uses only interfaces declared by Abstract Factory and Abstract Product classes


Use Cases of Abstract Factory Pattern : 
UI Toolkits: 
To create UI components that can be adapted to different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)

Database Connections: To create connections to different databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)

Document Generation: To generate different types of documents (PDF, HTML, Word)

Cross-Platform Applications: To support multiple platforms without changing the 
code that uses these interfaces

Conclusion :
The Abstract Factory pattern is a powerful and flexible design pattern that provides 
a way to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their 
concrete classes. This pattern promotes loose coupling and enhances scalability by 
allowing new product families to be introduced without altering existing code 
properly implemented, it can significantly improve the maintainability and flexibility 
of a software system
