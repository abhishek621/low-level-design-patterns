Builder : 

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to construct 
complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object 
from its representation so that the same construction process can create different 
representations. This pattern is especially useful when an object can be configured 
in many different ways or when the creation process involves multiple steps

Key Concepts of Builder Pattern : 
Builder Interface: Specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object

Concrete Builder: Implements the Builder interface to construct and assemble parts of the product

Product: The complex object that is being built

Director: Constructs an object using the Builder interface

Use Cases of Builder Pattern : 
Complex Objects: When an object requires numerous steps to construct

Immutable Objects: To build immutable objects where construction 
requires a set of mandatory attributes and a set of optional attributes

UI Components: For constructing complex UI elements with numerous configuration options

Configuration Objects: When creating configuration objects with a variety of parameters

Conclusion :
The Builder pattern is a powerful and flexible design pattern that allows for the 
step-by-step construction of complex objects. It is particularly useful in scenarios 
where an object requires multiple steps to construct or where there are numerous 
configurations and options. Properly implemented, it promotes code readability, 
maintainability, and separation of concerns by isolating the construction logic 
from the representation of the object
